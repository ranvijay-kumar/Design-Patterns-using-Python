# Gamma Categorisation
`Design patterns are typically split into three categories`

## Creational Patterns
`Deal with the creation (construction) of objects`
`Explicit (constructor) vs. implicit (DI, reflection, etc.)`
`Wholesale (single statement) vs. piecewise (step-by-step)`

## Structural Patterns
`Concerned with the structure (e.g.e class members)`
`Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the unerlying class' interface`
`Stress the importance of good API design`

## Behavioral Patterns
`They are all different; no central theme`
